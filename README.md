#Kia ora, welcome to one of my personal projects 'Movie List'

#This is an app designed to help you create a list of your favourite movies. Delete the movie when you decide that it's not your favourite anymore!
#This was part of one of the assignments in Dev Academy
#We were challenged to make an app that was fullstack where the database can be altered by the user. 
#The app already comes with populated seeds. 

#Therefore as a user, you can add your favourite movies and what year they were released by placing it in the input. Your input will then be added to the database
#Another feature of the app is deleting the movies you once added.
